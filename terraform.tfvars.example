# GitOps Approach: Account mappings are defined in account-mappings.yaml
# Terraform automatically reads the current AWS account ID and looks it up in the YAML file
# No need to specify account_application_mapping here - it's read from account-mappings.yaml

# Optional: Override the mappings file path (defaults to account-mappings.yaml)
# mappings_file_path = "account-mappings.yaml"

# Optional: Override channel routing (if not specified, reads from account-mappings.yaml)
# channel_routing = {
#   "DUP" = {
#     "dev"  = "#dup-dev-alerts"
#     "prod" = "#dup-prod-alerts"
#   }
